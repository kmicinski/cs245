I’m a PhD student in computer science at the University of Maryland,
College Park. My research focuses on security for mobile devices using
a combination of systems and language based techniques. I’m a member
of the [PLUM](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/) group, advised by
Jeff Foster. I also routinely collaborate with the rest of the members
of the PLUM lab and [Michael Clarkson](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~clarkson/).

You can find a list of my publications on my Google Scholar
profile. You may also be interested in the lab’s Github page.

# Projects

Major projects I’ve worked on include:

- The Redexer binary rewriter, with Jinseong Jeon and our
collaborators. Redexer instruments Dalvik binaries (the executable
format for Android apps), which we used for finer grained permissions
and measuring utility of apps with fuzzed inputs.

- Temporal Logics for Hyperproperties which seeks to develop logical
foundations for security statements that quantify over multiple
executions of a program and relate those executions using
predicates. This work allows stating a wide variety of statements
about program security, such as noninterference and observational
determinism.

- GUI based declassification for Android. My current work applies
static analysis to Android programs, using declassification policies
based on user inputs.
