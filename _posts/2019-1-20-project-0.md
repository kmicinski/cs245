In this project you will be implementing association lists in
C++. This project will give you some basic experience with building
data structures in C++ (one of its most common uses). This will likely
require that you do some reading on your own to understand how C++
classes work.

## Getting the project

Follow the steps at the [end of the previous
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7wLvLb2qCw&t=1018s). Get the
autograder by cloning the submission repo
[here](https://github.com/kmicinski/submit). Be sure to read the
instructions in that repository (in particular, read about how to make
sure it's working).

Let's say that you have the autograder submit script stored in
`~/projects/submit/submit.py`. Then you will create a new directory,
`p0`, for this project somewhere. Here's what I did to set up the
projects (note that I put them in `~/projects/cs245-playground`, I
recommend you just use a folder like ~/projects/cs245/p0`):

```
Kristophers-Air:projects kmicinski$ mkdir cs245-playground
Kristophers-Air:projects kmicinski$ cd cs245-playground/
Kristophers-Air:cs245-playground kmicinski$ mkdir p0
Kristophers-Air:cs245-playground kmicinski$ cd p0/
Kristophers-Air:p0 kmicinski$ cp ~/projects/submit/submit.py .
Kristophers-Air:p0 kmicinski$ python3 submit.py

    Note: it is very important that you do not do not
    distribute the `credentials` file. It stores your username and
    password. Please avoid sending it to anyone (doing so will be
    considered a violation of the honor code) or checking it into
    git.

    You must select the project whose shortname is the same as the
    name of this directory. If you want to work on a project not
    listed here (e.g., `proj0`), you must crate an empty directory
    with that name and run `submit.py` from that directory.

## Completing the project

Project instructions are given in the top of file
`AssocList.h`. Please read the instructions there and complete the
methods marked `TODO` in the file. The purpose of the lab is to have
you implement association lists: key/value maps based on lists of
(key,value) pairs.

## Running the lab yourself

If you want to test your program as you go, you first need to compile
a test. Each test file is written as one of the file in the `tests`
folder. You are encouraged to write your own, and the project includes
secret tests (that you won't be given)

    # Compile the test and create file output
    clang++ -std=c++14 -Wall -o ./output ./tests/<testname>.cpp
    # Run the test
    ./output
