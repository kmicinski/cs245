Welcome to CS245! I'm excited to have you in the course. There are a
few logistical notes:

- If you have a Microsoft Windows machine, please watch the following
  video on [how to set up a VirtualBox environment and the
  autograder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7wLvLb2qCw).

- Email me **immediately** to get your account credentials for the
  autograder. In your email please let me know when you plan to start
  lab 0.

- Please watch the [first video lecture on
  C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doUVMwJhC1M&t=28s).

- The first lab is due **soon**: the first day of class. The answer to
  the first lab should not take more than 3-10 lines of code, and you
  should be able to do it after watching the first video lecture.
